# ML Bootcamp 24 Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and data analysis projects that I have worked on during the ML Bootcamp 24 program. Each project is stored in a separate folder with its own README file providing detailed information about the project.

## Projects

1. **Sentiment Analysis on Customer Feedback using NLP**
   - This project performs sentiment analysis on customer feedback using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and TextBlob libraries in Python.
   - The analysis is presented through a Streamlit web application.

2. **Using Advanced Excel and Power BI to Analyze Data**
   - This project demonstrates the use of advanced Excel features and Power BI to analyze WhatsApp chat data.
   - It includes data cleaning, visualization, and the extraction of insights from the chat logs.

3. **Book Recommendation System**
   - This project implements a book recommendation system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
   - It allows users to search for books based on keywords and displays relevant book information.

4. **Diabetes Prediction and Analysis**
   - This project focuses on predicting the onset of diabetes using machine learning techniques.
   - It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models.
